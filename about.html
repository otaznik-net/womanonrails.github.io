<p>Since I have remember, I have always wanted to be a math teacher. I always wanted to teach others. Math is something simple and logical for me, but in most cases it&#39;s hard and complex for others. Since High School I have helped my friends in math. We even were organizing extra time for math learning before our final exam. After I graduated, I decided to go to Silesian University of Technology and study math. There was possibility to choose a specialization in math teaching.</p>

<p>The beginning of my studies was hard for me. But step by step I passed exams and I went through next semesters. Finally, I finished my 3rd year. This was time to choose a specialization. And then, we got information that math teaching branch will not open. There was not enough people to open it.</p>

<p>I was completely crushed. This was my big goal. <em>&quot;Will this goal stay only as a dream?&quot;</em> - I thought. I didn&#39;t know what to do next, but I had to choose the specialization. I made the decision: <em>&quot;Processing and information security&quot;</em>. This was the most IT focused specialization. I also gave myself time and space to think, what&#39;s next. This was the best decision. After some time I saw a new light in a tunnel, new possibilities.</p>

<p>In Poland, when you would like to be a teacher, you have 3 options (at least that was a case for me at that time): First, get master degree of pedagogy. Second, get master degree in any subject with pedagogy specialization (this was what I wanted to do). And last, do the external pedagogy course. I found out that this course is available at Silesian University of Technology. In my case, this course took me 2 years. I spent all my money from scholarship to do this course. I was so happy, that my dream can come true. You cannot even imagine! I could finish the math study and also be a teacher in the future.</p>

<p>Years passed by and last thing to do on my pedagogy course was internship in school. I have chosen a school near my home for this. After this internship, I was sure that I don&#39;t want to teach children at school. This didn&#39;t bring me a joy. I was thinking that teaching at school will be the same or similar to teaching in person. But I was wrong. It was completely opposite. I love teaching in person, but 45 minutes of the lesson is too short to understand the topic by everyone (in most cases). I had interaction only with some children in the class, but not with all of them. And trying to fit everyone needs, you don&#39;t fit them at all. This was not for me. I was sure about that.</p>

<p>This time I was completely terrified. My dream came true and this wasn&#39;t what I expected. I spent so much effort and time to reach this goal and I wasn&#39;t happy at all. I was sad. I was thinking how I could be so wrong? In this situation, what brings me joy? What I would like to do in my life? Should I open my own school and teach in person? I wasn&#39;t ready to be an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in my life one more thing appear, which was, and still is, exciting. It was mix of logic, puzzles, being precise, deduction and analytical thinking. It has lots of common with <strong>Math</strong>. In my life programming appear. I learned programming on my specialization, during my Math studies. I can say that this is my second love. The first love, of course, is math. It was a pleasure for me to resolve problems, during classes. So I decided to start studying Computer Science full time on my University as my second faculty.</p>

<p>It was a great decision. I was delighted. Computers stopped being for me incomprehensible machines. Now I could talk with them in the same language. To be honest, in many languages. I could do and create whatever I imagine, using only the keyboard! An amazing feeling!</p>

<p>In last year I started my internship in IT company <a href="https://fractalsoft.org/" title="Ruby on Rails web applications">Fractal Soft</a>. They focus on the creation of web applications using <strong>Ruby language</strong>. Ruby is beautiful, readable, simple and very flexible language. Writing in Ruby is pure pleasure. I started to learn more and more about Ruby.</p>

<p>But I still felt that there is something I miss. That feeling I need to learn more, that I&#39;m not good enough in programming. That I need to develop my skills more. One of my friends sent me information about workshops called <strong>Rails Girls</strong>. Next workshops were planned in Wroclaw. You have to fill forms and best 30 people will get invitations to this workshop.</p>

<p>I was so scared, what if I&#39;m not good enough? So, I didn&#39;t fill the form. When first stress went away, I regretted my choice. I was sad, that I didn&#39;t have the courage to try. I was honest with myself and I swore that if this workshop will appear one more time I will do everything to go there.</p>

<p>So I did that. Next workshops were organized in Poznan. I filled the form, the best I could. And I got a chance to be a part of Rails Girls workshops. This event was amazing! Never before I felt so much good energy, atmosphere, support and wish to share knowledge. This was an unforgettable experience and people. I&#39;m glad that I was a part of this.</p>

<p>After this workshop I got so much positive energy, that I decide to go step further and be a mentor on next polish Rails Girls workshops. I wanted to give something from my side to this new (at least for me) community. Then Rails Girls Warsaw come up. So I decided to be a mentor. I was a little bit scared, but also happy at the same time. I found my third love: <strong>teaching programming</strong> and <strong>sharing knowledge</strong>.</p>

<p>This was it. I started traveling around a Poland and <strong>teach programming</strong>. I love to show people how IT is wonderful and you don&#39;t need to be afraid of it. I was showing a world of computers, programming and web applications. Then I organized my own Rails Girls&#39; events: <a href="http://railsgirls.com/silesia">Rails Girls Gliwice</a> and <a href="http://railsgirls.com/cieszyn">Rails Girls Cieszyn</a>. After that I started helping with CoderDojo organization and teach kids programming. I love watching when, after a long time of hard work a person understand the problem. When this person says that after all it is not so hard like she/he was thinking. This is the best reward for me.</p>

<p>Now <strong>programming</strong> is my life. Sharing knowledge and continuous learning is my mission. This is why I&#39;m here on <strong>Woman on Rails</strong> blog. I can share my knowledge in more world wide way. I can reach to many people. I can reach also to you!</p>

<p>Thank you, for being here. This motivates me for next articles and next projects.</p>

<p>Do you like this place? If so, share your thoughts with me and the others.</p>
