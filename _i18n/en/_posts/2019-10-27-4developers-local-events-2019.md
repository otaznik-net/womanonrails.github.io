In one of my last article I wrote about my new challenge. To be a speaker at the conference. This happened two times at local editions of 4Developers in Krakow and in Katowice. It was for me interesting experience. Especially that this audience don't know Ruby as programming language too much. I had a change to share with them my knowledge about Ruby and good programming practices. In close future there will be two more local editions of 4Developers. And because of that I have a surprise for you which is prepared together with 4Developers organizers. Discount for these two events and one free ticket which you can win. But let's start from the beginning.

<!--break-->

4Developers is a conference where the main edition took a place in April in Warsaw this year (2019). This is an event which brings over 2,000 participants interested in IT world in one place. It doesn't matter if you are working in Python, JavaScript, PHP or other technology. There were 14 paths related to different topics like cloud computing, data science, mobile or even soft skills. After this one big event during the year you can find smaller local editions, which have similar structure. Different topics on different paths, but each local event has its own atmosphere. Krakow and Katowice are already after local event. You can find more about them in my previous article about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/4developers-2019" title='4Developers 2019'>4Developers</a>. Now we are waiting for Wroclaw 5th of November and Poznan 18th of November. The end of this IT marathon will be in Gdansk at 27th of November where will take a place 4Developers OFFLINE.
