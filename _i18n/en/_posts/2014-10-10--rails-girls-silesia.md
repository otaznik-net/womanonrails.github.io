I took long way from being a participant in Rails Girls workshops, through being a mentor and right now I organized **Rails Girls in Gliwice**. I'm very proud, because this was one of my dreams!

After I started my adventure with [Rails Girls initiative in Poznan]({{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-rules) in 2013 as participant, my next deam was to be a mentor. First time this happend on [Rails Girls Warsaw in 2014]({{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-warsaw). It was for me amazing expirence! The next workshops, as a mentor, were [Rails Girls Cracow]({{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-cracow). I teached very young girls, who wanted in the future work in IT. After that I wanted more and more and more. I went thorugh whole Poland to be a mentor and share my knowladge. So I travel from Warsaw to Cracow, Wroclaw, Łódź and Szczecin. Then I went back to Poznań, but this time as a mentor. Each time I was traveling to next Rails Girls workshops, peapole in Rails Girls community asked me: _So, when you will ogranized your own Rails Girls workshops?_ I started working on it and after many month of preparation we are here in Gliwice organizing **Rails Girls Silesia**.
