It took me a long way from being a participant in Rails Girls workshops, through being a mentor and right now organizing **Rails Girls in Gliwice**. I'm very proud of our team. It was hard work and lot of engagement. And now my dream came true! Let's start this story from the beginning...

My adventure with Rails Girls started in 2013. I got information about the Rails Girls workshop in Wroclaw. Unfortunately, because I was scared and not sure of my skills, I didn't register. After registration was closed I regretted my decision. I promised myself that I will participate in next workshops. This opportunity happened on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }} /rails-girls-rules" title="Rails Girls workshops - participant perspective">Rails Girls Poznan</a>. After those workshops I came back full of motivation. I wanted to help others.  To be a mentor, that was my next plan. First time this took place at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-warsaw" title="Rails Girls workshops - mentor perspective">Rails Girls Warsaw</a> in 2014. It was an amazing experience. The next workshops, as a mentor, were at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-cracow" title="Rails Girls workshops for young">Rails Girls Cracow</a>. I taught very young girls, who wanted to work in IT in the future. After that I wanted more, and more, and more. I went thorough Poland to be a mentor and shared my knowledge. So I traveled from Warsaw to Cracow, Wroclaw, Łódź and Szczecin. Then I went back to Poznań, but this time as a mentor. Each time I was traveling to next Rails Girls workshops, people in the Rails Girls community asked me: _So, when you will organize your own Rails Girls workshops?_ I started working on it and after many months of preparation we are here in Gliwice, organizing **Rails Girls Silesia**.
