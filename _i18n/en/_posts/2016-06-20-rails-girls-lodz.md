<br>
I'm really Rails Girls freak! After weekend on Rails Girls Warsaw, I went to the next workshops. This time, I was in Łódź on third edition of **Rails Girls Łódź**. I love the atmospthere of this workshops. It is always pleasure for me to share my knowlage and to see that other women want to try new things.

As usually workshops started on Friday. We set up enviroments on girls' laptops and discussed what would they like to create during workshops. After this instalation party was dinner for mentors. This is special time for us to talk a little bit about chalanges for the next day of workshops. On saturday, as usualy, we started early in the morning just after breakfast. There was time for learning and coding. On afternoon after lunch we all watch short lighting talks. They are greate to inspire and show posibilitis in IT. In this special workshops we also had possibility to connect with other Rails Girls workshops which take a place at the same time but in different country! I'm realy greatefull that I can be a part of Rails Girls community.

In this year there will be even more Rails Girls events where I will appeare. And one of them will be very special, so stay tune!

In meantime you an watch video from Rails Girls Łódź. Bye!
