I'm a really Rails Girls freak! After a weekend with Rails Girls Warsaw, I went to the next workshops. This time, I was in Łódź on the third edition of **Rails Girls Łódź**. I love the atmosphere of this workshop. It is always pleasure for me to share my knowledge and to see that other women want to try new things.

As usually workshops started on Friday. We set up the environment on girls' laptops and discussed what would they like to create during workshops. After this installation party, was a dinner for mentors. This is a special time for us to talk a little bit about challenges for the next day of workshops. On Saturday, as usual, we started early in the morning just after a breakfast. There was a time for learning and coding. On the afternoon, after lunch, we all watched short lighting talks. They are great to inspire and show possibilities in IT. In this special workshops we also had possibility to connect with other Rails Girls workshops which take a place at the same time but in a different country! I'm really grateful that I can be a part of the Rails Girls community.

In this year there will be even more Rails Girls events where I will appear. And one of them will be a very special one, so stay tune!

In meantime, you an watch video from Rails Girls Łódź. Bye!
