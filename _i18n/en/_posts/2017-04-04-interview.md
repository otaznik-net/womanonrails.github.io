From some time I do interviews. I'm not a HR person. I'm developer. I do technical interviews for my company. My responsibility is to check how experience is person which apply for job. How this person fit to our team form technical and personal point of view. This process is not about be perfect. More about be honest. Finally team and candidate should be able to work together. Today I would like to tell you a little bit about what I expect from person on interview. I would like to show my point of view on this kind of conversation.

For me is very important to respect others time. So I'm always prepare to the conversation. I read CV, prepare questions regards to skills, knowledge of person and project which she/he worked with. Each time I do that separately, because each person is different and have different experience. I spend some time on preparation to don't waste others time. The same I would like to get from candidate. To **be prepare** to conversation. I don't expect all correct answers. I expect own opinion, logical thinking, easy moving in technologies which she/he work with. Of course on specific level. It's depends of position which we offer. There are different expectations for junior and different expectations for senior.

As I said the most important on interview is to **be prepared**. This is the key to success. Even person isn't someone who we are looking for now. For example we are looking someone to backend but person have more frontend skills but have interesting point of view, and is good in her/his job. I will remember this person. And I will reach to this person when we will need someone like she/he. Even this will be another project.

What those mean **be prepared**? What you should do to **be prepared**?

1. Know your CV

    When I start my preparations I always read CV. This is base for my starting questions. I ask about projects, technologies, architecture in this projects. Everything related with information in CV. Dates, projects, approximate time of work and others skills, trainings. It is very important to be aware what you have in CV. So when you are before interview go through all information which you have in CV and remind yourself what were your responsibilities in this project? What technologies do you use? How you resolved problems? This is not good impression when you read your own CV on interview. The same when you tell that you don't remember your last project and it was month ago. Of course this is normal that you don't remember what you did 5 years ago. Although when you go to interview you should remind yourself last 2-3 projects. This is also good place to tell about one more think. Never, ever add to your CV elements which you don't know. It is easy to check your knowledge about that and very hard to change first bad impression.

2. Remember projects and companies

    This is part of first point. I would like to mark that. Who should know better projects and companies which you work for, then you? I really ask about this. About responsibilities in projects, architecture, what is project about. If you don't want to talk about something or you cannot do that, maybe you shouldn't put it into CV. Of course there are projects with NDA. In this cases you should also go through this project and think what you can say and what not. This is example how I prepare questions: If you put in CV that your project was done on microservices, you should know how looks like architecture? How looks like communication between services? What is for you service? Do you like this kind of architecture? Advantages and disadvantages?

3. What's new in your sector

    This not only related with interview. You should know news from your environment on daily bases. In my opinion working in IT need developing skill all the time. I know it is hard to know all news. I also have problem to stay keep up to date with technology, but still trying. It is good to refresh knowledge from time to time. On interview I will ask about:  What is last version of your language? What are new features in framework? Any new libraries? New concepts or ideas? This will allow me to check how you take care about your skills. I know it is impossible to know everything if you don't know something just tell me that. As I say, be honest, don't lie.

4. Tools, workflow, interesting applications

    I always ask about workflow, about tools, editors, system, version control. How you work? Which libraries, gems do you use? Everything related with work. How to be effective? How to have good communication in team? How to check if code is good quality? Maybe you know something about TDD, metrics, PR/MR (pull/merge request), code standards, work remote. I'm interested in your opinion about this topics. I would like to know if you are conscious programmer. If you know, what will make you more effective. What will increase comfort of your work?

5. Architecture

    What do you do in project to have good architecture, good code quality? What do you do to be able in fast and easy way do some changes in code? Design patters? Programming rules? Code standard? Main concept of language? Frameworks?

6. Company information

    This is more important for you. You apply for job. You should know:  What company do? What is product of this company? What is market for them? How looks structure of company? How looks theirs product? Sometime on interview I ask about this informations but rarely. This should be interesting for you. It is better know this informations before sending CV. You will save your and also others time.

7. Be prepare to show you code

    On short conversation it is hard to ask all questions and check all knowledge. Specially code related. So I always ask about some code example, project access. It is very good when person have something to show and this is not only Rails Scaffold. This should be something which you are proud of.

8.  Be ready to some life coding

    I know this is very stressful situation. Specially when someone watch you each move. For me it is one of the best possibility to check your programming skills. How you handle problems, how you work in stress, how you think about problem, how look like your communications skills. In this moment don't think about me just tell what you are doing, think about problem, ask when something is not clear and everything will be fine.

9. Methodologies

    When this is not you first project you should be able to say something about methodologies. Do you work in team? How you work? How big was your team? How did you organize your work? Did you use any methodology? Which one? Do you use Scrum, Agile, Waterfall, Lean? What you use to communications? How you fix bugs, create new features? How you deal with your client? How you solved problems? What you like and don't like in this methodology? And why?

10. Prepare some questions for me

    There is lot of things you would like to ask. Maybe about our workflow. About team. About features. About code quality. Architecture. I always really happy to answer your questions. There is nothing better then person which know what he/she know or not. And have enough courage to ask, questions. Finally you also be exited to join our team.

There is one more and very important request for you. All this tips are from my point of view. What I expect from person on interview. This is not way to cheat, but way to be better prepared. Be honest with yourself and with recruiter. In the end this is important for both sides to know each other. To check if we match together. Company can choose you, but you also need to choose the company. This is some kind of agreement. Everyone should be happy about working together.
